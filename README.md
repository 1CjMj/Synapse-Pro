# Synapse-Pro
A2SV Hackathon Project. It's a card based gamified learning project.

This project is a cutting-edge learning platform and game that combines AI-powered flashcards, interactive simulations, gamification, real-time feedback and personalized voice tutoring.
This will create a comprehensive and engaging learning experience.
Idealy this project seeks to help mitigate the lack of availability of education and tuitoin for all especially in Africa, despite the available budget.
The Use of AI models from Gemini and OpenAI will help condense and simplify the information from various sources and the gamification aspect will help expand the attention span as well as the information retention of the target users.

# Features:
- AI powered flashcards with adaptiv difficulty and real-time feedback.
- Interactive simulation and animations to illustrate complex concepts.
- Gamification elements, such as points, badges and leaderboards.
- Virtual labs and investigations for hans-on learning.
- AI voice tutoring providing personalised guidance, feedback and support.
- Fine-tuned AI models for increassed accuracy and relavance.
- User-friendly UI for easy navigation and use.
- Real-time analytics for tracking progress and identifying progress and areas for improvement

# Structure
- backend/ : for backend code, API endpoints, DB models implemented 
- frontend/ : for frontend code and visual components such as images and videos. Code will be in JavaScript, react-typescript and tailwind CSS
- models/ : for AI models created using python as well as other AI related files
- bot/ : for code and assets that'll be used by the bot which will work with the user.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
